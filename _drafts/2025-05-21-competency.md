# Competency
The thing I admire most about people is competency. I look up to those who have done
hard things often enough that they look effortless. I detest incompetency. I dislike 
those who claim to be competent but really aren't. I have to be able to verify 
that someone isn't a fraud before I come to respect their leadership. I think
it's a really important skill to to be able to judge someone's competency,
otherwise you'll be easily fooled by people who have the shameless confidence
to roleplay as someone who knows what they're talking about. You'll find yourself
following charlatans and repeating their nonsense, or worse, giving them your money.

I try very hard to be competent. I think it's cool to be competent and very
uncool to not be. I try hard to not claim to be an expert on things that I'm 
not an expert on. I'm not even sure that I can call myself an expert on anything yet.
At what point should you start to talk about something you have experience in? 
It could be just that. You don't talk about anything you don't have experience in, 
lest you say something stupid and prove your incompetence. It takes time to become
an expert in anything. I find that usually loud people aren't very competent in anything.
The real competent people have their head down, being you know, good at what they do.

I think it's immoral to claim to be something you're not. I think people who do 
just that get quite far in life sometimes, though. In my opinion, only a selfish person 
would claim to be something their not. At the same time, it's important for people
who truly are masters in their craft to know that they are. Or to atleast know the span 
of their skill or knowledge. That way you can discern the real from the fake in
your wheelhouse, and safeguard those who might believe something they shouldn't. 

Your competency should be provable at a moment's notice. Either through accolades
or through a demonstration of your skill. I think we should hold people more accountable
and shame those who have claimed to be something their not. 

Where did this post come from? I don't know. These are the things that I think about
before bed. I hope that I can surround myself with compent.
