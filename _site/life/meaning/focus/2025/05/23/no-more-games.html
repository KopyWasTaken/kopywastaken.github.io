<p>I can’t keep playing video games. They’re too fun, and they take up way too much
of my time and focus. They act as a substitute for accomplishment and social
interaction, even though the “accomplishments” aren’t real and the social
interaction isn’t as good as it would be in person. They make me sit around
all day, and they’re so fun that I sometimes can’t pull myself away from
them long enough to exercise (which always makes me feel better than gaming) 
or walk my dog.</p>

<p>Yesterday was one of those days. It rained all day, and the first thing that I did
when I woke up (after making coffee and walking the dog) after seeing the weather
was hop on my computer and boot up Doom: Eternal. Besides ripping a line of fent-laced
coke and being put into a straight-jacket, I can’t think of a fucking worse way to 
start a day. I’m 26, in my physical prime (somewhat), and I squander this time (that 
will be gone before I know it) by playing a fucking video game for like 6 hours. 
I will lose my sanity if I let this continue, because it’s been a problem for a while 
and I haven’t taken the appropriate steps to address it.</p>

<p>They kept me out of trouble as a kid. But they also kept my lonely. They got me interested
in computers, which is what my career is now. But they’ve also cost me 
thousands of dollars at this point. There’s no free lunch, and I am paying a high 
cost now in my prime by continuing to play them.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no doubt that I will be happier, healthier, more socially active, 
thoughtful, productive, and financially better off by stopping playing them. And 
that’s what I am going to do. Cold turkey. Fuck the CS2 skins. Fuck the new graphics card 
and monitor. It doesn’t matter, and those things can be sold off and their value 
converted. My time in this life, especially in the prime of my life, will never 
be mine again. It is an invalueable resource. I refuse to waste it on video games 
any more.</p>
